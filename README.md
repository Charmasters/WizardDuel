# WizardDuel
Final semester project from senior year of highschool (Fa 2021).

This project was coded in Javascript for the fall semester of my highschool mechatronics class. The project is stored on code.org. 

This is meant to be a two-player competative video game. Each player is a wizard capable of casting spells by pressing arrow keys in the right order; however, both players share the queue of previously pressed arrow keys. Given any order of previously pressed keys (assuming there are two or more pressed keys in the queue) there is some spell that can be cast in one key press. Ideally, both players would have to plan around their opponent to cast the spells they want to cast. 

This is an old idea that I used to test coding in Javascript. The project utilizes many graphical effects as well as minor qualityof life features.
